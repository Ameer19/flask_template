# flask_template

A boilerplate Flask template to get you up and developing in no time.

`Docker` + `Python3` + `Flask` + `uWSGI`

Get your Flask project started quickly!

There are 3 application patterns to choose from:
* The traditional `app.py`
    * If you've run the the `hello world` app example from the Flask website, you know this well.
* `Application factory`
    * A more modular approach to Flask
* `Class based views`
    * This is a variation of the `application factory` pattern where each route is handled by a single `Class`

To try one out, just `cd` into that directory and `make run-dev`

Each directory here is a self contained `mini-repo` of sorts
